2. **Decentralization by Design**: Build systems that function without central control or orchestration
3. **Developer Experience**: Make stigmergic and stochastic programming accessible to developers
4. **Scalability**: Ensure the framework can scale to support massive agent swarms with minimal overhead
5. **Community-Driven**: Incorporate feedback and contributions from the community

## Conclusion

The Intellex Framework aims to evolve from an orchestration-focused system to one that supports true emergence and self-organization among diverse agent populations. By embracing stigmergic communication and stochastic behaviors, we can create more resilient, adaptive, and innovative agent systems that better mirror natural intelligent systems and unlock new possibilities for artificial intelligence.
